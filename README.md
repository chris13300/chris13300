- 👋 Hello, I'm Chris, 44 years old, living in France since 1980, liking electro musics and racing car video games...
- 👀 Since 2006, i develop vb tools with/without mdb/xml databases. Since 2015, I’m interested in chess engines.
- 🌱 I’m currently training chess engines, previously i trained NNUE nets with "nodchip" release of Stockfish.
- 🌱 Generally, i post my results at [OpenChess Forum (deeds)](https://www.open-chess.org/index.php).
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate with chess engine authors who had added a learning feature to their chess engines.
